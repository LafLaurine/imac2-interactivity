## Synopsis 

[Let's draw](https://interactivity-letsdraw.herokuapp.com/).

Two interactive huge screens full of light and colors, with music coming out of it, placed in two train stations from different countries, that allows passers-by to play Pictionary with their body. You either choose to play with people from the city you’re going or another city available. There is entertaining music that comes out this screen in order to attract people. The aim is to collect art furnitures for an art association that developed art in underprivileged context.
How to play ? Well it’s very simple : multiple players from city A draw something with their body, city B players guess what it is. If they guess, city A player wins a set of pencils for the art association. 

The social bond is what takes a big place in our project.
